# Tutor Progress Tracker

## Overview
Tutor Progress Tracker is a desktop application designed specifically for private tutors to efficiently manage their students’ progress, assignments, and parent communications. It aims to streamline the administrative workload that tutors face, especially when managing over 20 students, allowing them to focus more on teaching and creating personalized learning resources.

## Problem Statement
Private tutors with a large number of students often spend excessive time tracking student progress, updating parents, and monitoring assignment submissions. This administrative overhead limits their capacity to provide tailored instruction and restricts the number of students they can effectively support.

## Key Features (Ideas)
- Track student progress over time
- Manage homework and assignment submissions
- Save and organize parent contact details
- Maintain comprehensive student profiles
- Filter data by individual students
- View assignments categorized by pending or completed status
- Visualize student progress easily through intuitive views

## Value Proposition
Our application acts as an address book that simplifies the management of student progress and assignment tracking, helping tutors in planning lessons and providing timely updates to parents. This reduces administrative burden, freeing tutors to focus on grading, giving feedback, and designing learning materials targeted at their students’ specific weaknesses.

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the needs of private tutors striving to improve their workflow and impact.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
